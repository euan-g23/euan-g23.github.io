	<!-- SHORT ABSTRACT (RECRUITER OPTIMISED) -->
	<p>
		A dynamic aeroelastic flutter model was developed for a two-dimensional aerofoil using MATLAB
		and Simulink, incorporating coupled plunge and pitch motion and later extended to include a
		trailing-edge flap. The simulations were used to identify flutter onset and assess stability
		sensitivity to aerodynamic and structural parameters. The work highlights both the effectiveness
		of reduced-order aeroelastic models and the practical challenges involved in extending them to
		higher-fidelity configurations.

	<!-- AT A GLANCE -->
	<h3 class="_secondary-title">At a Glance</h3>
	<ul class="_list">
		<li><strong>Methods:</strong> Reduced-order aeroelastic modelling (2DOF → 3DOF)</li>
		<li><strong>Tools:</strong> MATLAB, Simulink</li>
		<li><strong>Focus:</strong> Flutter onset, stability analysis, model extension</li>
	</ul>

	<!-- CONTEXT -->
	<h3 class="_secondary-title">Problem Context</h3>
	<p>
		Aeroelastic flutter represents a critical dynamic instability driven by the coupling between
		aerodynamic loading and structural response. Reduced-order models are widely used during early
		design stages, but their validity and limitations must be well understood when extending model
		fidelity or incorporating additional degrees of freedom.
	</p>

	<!-- MODELLING APPROACH -->
	<h3 class="_secondary-title">Modelling Approach</h3>
	<p>
		The aerofoil was modelled initially as a two-degree-of-freedom system with coupled plunge and
		pitch motion, implemented in MATLAB and Simulink. Aerodynamic forcing was represented using
		linear unsteady aerodynamics, with time-domain simulations used to assess dynamic stability
		under varying flow conditions. The model was later extended to include a trailing-edge flap,
		introducing an additional degree of freedom.
	</p>

	<!-- RESULTS -->
	<h3 class="_secondary-title">Key Results</h3>
	<p>
		The simulations successfully identified flutter onset through divergence in time-domain
		responses. While the 2DOF model exhibited stable and interpretable behaviour, the introduction
		of a flap increased system sensitivity and highlighted numerical and formulation challenges
		associated with higher-order aeroelastic models.
	</p>

	<!-- LIMITATIONS -->
	<h3 class="_secondary-title">Limitations & Engineering Lessons</h3>
	<p>
		The study demonstrated that while reduced-order aeroelastic models are effective for identifying
		flutter trends, extending them to higher-fidelity configurations requires careful formulation
		and validation. The work emphasised the importance of model transparency, stability diagnostics,
		and understanding the limits of simplified aerodynamic assumptions.
