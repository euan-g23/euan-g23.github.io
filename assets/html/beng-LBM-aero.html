  <!-- PROJECT SNAPSHOT -->
  <p>
    A dissertation evaluating the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) as an alternative CFD approach for
    aerodynamic research, using the open-source Palabos solver to simulate airflow around an urban
    two-building model. The project was motivated by unsteady wind effects around buildings and their
    potential impact on air ambulance operations in dense urban environments.

  <!-- AT A GLANCE -->
  <h3 class="_secondary-title">At a Glance</h3>
  <ul class="_list">
    <li><strong>Methods:</strong> Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM), CFD validation, mesh resolution comparison</li>
    <li><strong>Case Study:</strong> Two-building “channelling effect” / urban bluff-body flow</li>
    <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Palabos (C++), Linux/MPI, Creo (CAD), ParaView, MATLAB</li>
    <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Solver setup, stability, post-processing, comparison to wind-tunnel/CFD reference data</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- CONTEXT -->
  <h3 class="_secondary-title">Problem Context</h3>
  <p>
    Flow around buildings can produce localised acceleration, turbulence, and recirculation—particularly
    within narrow passages between structures (the “channelling effect”). These unsteady conditions are
    relevant to operational safety for low-altitude aircraft and heliport planning. This project investigated
    whether LBM tools can practically simulate these aerodynamic features on limited computing resources,
    and how reliably results can be validated against established reference studies.
  </p>

  <!-- WORKFLOW -->
  <h3 class="_secondary-title">Simulation Workflow</h3>
  <img class="_image"
       src="../images/beng-thesis/beng-thesis-workflow-EG.png"
       width="400" height="400"
       alt="Workflow figure showing building geometry, domain setup, or a ParaView post-processing output.">

  <p>
    The workflow began with familiarisation and benchmarking of Palabos using a standard 2D cavity case,
    before progressing to a 3D two-building configuration based on published literature. The building
    geometry was replicated in Creo and exported for use in Palabos, with simulations executed using a
    Linux environment and MPI to utilise available CPU resources. Post-processing in ParaView was used
    to extract key quantities (e.g., velocity profiles at pedestrian height, streamline patterns, and temporal
    stability behaviour), with additional plotting and processing performed in MATLAB where needed.

  <!-- RESULTS -->
  <h3 class="_secondary-title">Key Results</h3>

        alt="Representative result figure such as velocity ratio validation, streamline comparison, or turbulence intensity plot.">

  <p>
    The Palabos LBM setup successfully reproduced qualitative flow features expected for bluff-body urban
    aerodynamics, including recirculation regions behind buildings and accelerated flow through the channel.
    A resolution comparison (dx = 2 m vs dx = 4 m) indicated that finer spacing moved results closer to
    reference trends, but overall quantitative agreement with published velocity ratios and turbulence intensity
    data remained weak due to coarse grid limitations and measurement sensitivity at pedestrian height.
    Time-history monitoring of velocity components was used to assess solution stability and select appropriate
    sampling windows for post-processing.
  </p>

  <!-- LIMITATIONS -->
  <h3 class="_secondary-title">Limitations & Lessons</h3>
  <p>
    The primary limitation was computational resource, which constrained grid resolution and therefore the
    ability to match validation datasets in highly turbulent near-ground regions. The project highlighted the
    importance of (1) selecting validation metrics that are robust to spatial resolution, (2) monitoring stability
    and convergence before extracting data, and (3) documenting solver setup and post-processing steps so the
    study can be repeated under improved hardware conditions. The work also reinforced the learning curve
    associated with open-source CFD tooling (Linux, MPI, C++ build environments), and how these skills
    translate directly into practical simulation workflow capability.
